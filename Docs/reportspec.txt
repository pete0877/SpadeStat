Report types:

--------------------------------

Tournament Summary Report: shows statistics about players
and how they have performed in different levels of
tournaments. Columns: Player Name, Total number of
tournaments, Total cost of the tournaments, Total money won
from the tournaments, Net winnings, Return on Investment 
Percentage, Number of times in the money, Percentage of 
times in the money, Average number of players, Average 
finishing place, Total number of 1sts/2nds/3rds, Number of
satellite seats won.

Explanation of columns:

TotalCost - this reflects the total cost of all of the 
tournaments the player has played. This includes the 
tournament fee (the vig) that is not added to the prize
pool. It also includes the cost of rebuys the player has 
made (that you are aware of, if any).
TotalWin$ - this reflects the total amount of money won 
from the tournaments the player has played.
Net$ - this reflects the total amount of money won from all
tournaments minus the cost of those tournaments.
ROI% - this is the percentage of net money won divided by 
the total cost of all tournaments. If a player has won $45 
dollars from 2 tournaments that cost $10 each, then the net
money won is $25 and the ROI% is 120%
ITM# - this is the number of times the player has finished 
within the pay line.
ITM% - this is the percentage of times the player has 
finished within the pay line divided by the total number of
tournaments
Avg#Players - this is the average number of players in the
tournaments in which this player has played. The lower it
is, the smaller the field the player usually plays against.
AvgPlacement - this is the average placement of the player
within the field. The lower this number is shows that the 
player is placing well.
1st/2nd/3rd - this is the number of first/second/third 
place finishes that the player has received
Sats - this is the number of satellite seats that the 
player has won.

Action report: shows statistics about players and their 
tendencies in the hands in which you've played against 
them. Five columns: Player name, Total Number of Hands 
played, Percentage of times the player raised preflop, 
Percentage of times the player attempted a blind steal, 
Percentage of times the player voluntarily put money in the
pot.

Explanation of columns:

Percentage of times the player raised preflop - this 
reflects the total number of hands the player raised 
preflop (not necessarily as the first-in player) over the
number of hands the player has played. If the player has 
raised five hands preflop, and has played 20 hands against 
you, his percentage is 20%
Percentage of times the player attempted a blind steal - 
this reflects the total number of times the player raised 
preflop as the first player in while on the button or in 
the cutoff over the number of hands where the player was on
the button or in the cutoff. If the player has played 80 
hands against you, 20 of those in the cutoff or the button,
and of those 20, he raised as the first-in player 4 times, 
then the percentage would be 16%.
Percentage of times the player voluntarily put money in the
pot - this reflects the total number of hands the player 
put money into the pot voluntarily over the number of hands
the player has played. If the player has played in 100 
hands, and of those he put money in 16 times, but 4 of 
those were blinds where he didn't continue past the flop or
folded to a raise preflop, then his percentage would be 12%

Starting Hands report: a two-part report, it shows the
action report statistics for the player about whom the 
report is run. Also, it shows the hands about which you 
have seen the player play. 

First section: This section lists the action report stats
about the player for whom the report is written. This is
data about all of the hands you have played against this
player, summarized for quick reference. Four columns:
Total number of hands, Percentage of Preflop Raises.
Percentage of blind steals, percentage of times the player
voluntarily put money in the pot.

Explanation of columns:

Percentage of times the player raised preflop - this 
reflects the total number of hands the player raised 
preflop (not necessarily as the first-in player) over the
number of hands the player has played. If the player has 
raised five hands preflop, and has played 20 hands against 
you, his percentage is 20%
Percentage of times the player attempted a blind steal - 
this reflects the total number of times the player raised 
preflop as the first player in while on the button or in 
the cutoff over the number of hands where the player was on
the button or in the cutoff. If the player has played 80 
hands against you, 20 of those in the cutoff or the button,
and of those 20, he raised as the first-in player 4 times, 
then the percentage would be 16%.
Percentage of times the player voluntarily put money in the
pot - this reflects the total number of hands the player 
put money into the pot voluntarily over the number of hands
the player has played. If the player has played in 100 
hands, and of those he put money in 16 times, but 4 of 
those were blinds where he didn't continue past the flop or
folded to a raise preflop, then his percentage would be 12%

Second Section: This section lists the known hands that the
player has played. It lists the hand combination (including
whether it was unsuited, suited or double-suited (if it is
an Omaha hand)), the number of times it has been seen, the
percentage of times the player has won with it, the total
amount won in dollars, the net amount won in dollars, the
average amount won in dollars, the average big bets won per
hand (if the hand was received in NL or PL - this will be the
big blinds won per hand), the number of times the hand was
received in the blinds, the percentage of time the player has
voluntarily put money in the pot with the hand, the percentage
of times the player has won money with the hand without a flop,
the percentage of times the player has raised preflop, the
percentage of times the player has open-raised preflop (as the
first player in), the percentage of times the player has taken
the hand to showdown and the percentage of times the player
has won with the hand at showdown.

Explanation of columns:

Hand Combinations can reflect the actual hand combination (23ss,
AAos, etc in Hold'em or A234ds, AA33ss, etc in Omaha) or could
reflect several combinations in total (for Hold'em: Axss or Kxos;
for Omaha: A2xxss, KKxxds, etc). If there are no records of the
hand combination for the player, there will not be a row in the
report for it. The report can be quite long if there is a lot of
data about the player in a particular game.
