		Following are the report types currently supported:

			<li> Ring game summaries to see which limits have proven to be the best for you overall - see your results in dollars per hour or big bets per 100 hands. 
			<li> Action summaries - see how often your opponents are seeing the flop in comparison to you. See how often they raise or attempt a steal of a blind. 
			<li> Hand Combination reports allow you to see just how often you are playing each hand combination - and whether it has been profitable for you. For a change, see what knowledge you have about your opponents and identify leaks in their games for the next time you sit with them.
