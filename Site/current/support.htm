		<strong>Question:</strong>  What sites do you support and when will other sites become available?
		<p>
		<strong>Answer: </strong>

		        Development is underway to expand SpadeStat's capabilities for other sites. Currently, Party Poker and its skins are the next site to be expanded into. After that, there are a number of sites on our lists, but it will depend upon the desires of our customer.

		<strong>Question:</strong>  Will you ever support real-time importing of data off of poker site client software?
		<p>
		<strong>Answer: </strong>
		<ul>
			As this is known to be a desired feature for many, yes, we will strive to make this possible. It has not been determined when this feature will be implemented, but we will keep everyone appraised of our progress as developments are made.

		<strong>Question:</strong>  How do I use the Database Query section? What is SQL?
		<p>
		<strong>Answer: </strong>
		<ul>
			The database query tab is for advanced users only and really only for people who understand the syntax of the SQL query language. There are plenty of resources to teach someone how to use SQL query language, and we hope that some of our users will research them.
       			 SQL stands for Standard Query Language and is a database standard for most available databases. SpadeStat uses PostGreSql - which is merely an open-source variant of SQL.

		</ul>
